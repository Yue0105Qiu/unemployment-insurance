# The steps after you become unemployed from the PhD contract.

## University side

The university will help register your case in the Swedish Job Security Foundation, [Trygghetsstiftelsen](https://www.tsn.se/). Where you can get help from an assigned advisor. You can also update your profile in TSN and seek for some opportunities in their system. Meanwhile, there are some useful seminars and workshops to attend, and you might meet PhDs in similar situations to you.

Note that  [Trygghetsstiftelsen](https://www.tsn.se/) also offers financial aid, [A-kasseförstärkning](https://minasidor.tsn.se/sv/kund/min-ekonomi/akf/), which is a supplement on top of unemployment insurance that helps you to receive compensation equivalent to 80 percent of your established salary for 44 days.



## Public system side

On the first day of your unemployment, you need to register in the [arbetsförmedlingen](https://arbetsformedlingen.se/), where you also update your profile and fill in some information regarding your skills, the types of work you would like to do, etc. It is not necessary that you register at the first day. This only affects if you can get compensation from the first day of unemployment.

After you have registered in arbetsförmedlingen, you start applying for compensation from your unemployment insurance fund, which, in our case, is usually [Akademikernas a-kassa](https://www.akademikernasakassa.se/). Then in the system of Akademikernas a-kassa, you again need to update your profile and fill in some information. One special thing here is the employer certificate. On the university webpage, it is said like:
<img src="Fig\Employer certificate.jpeg" alt="Employer certificate" style="zoom:70%;" />

In my case, I already had no access to SSC Portal so I just call the number. Note that the call time is on **weekdays 09.00-12.00**. You can call them and give them your personal number, and asked them to issue that file for you. It usually is done very quickly. I got the file on the same day when I called them. This file was not sent directly to my email. Instead, it appeared in [Arbetsgivaringtyg](https://www.arbetsgivarintyg.nu/#/). You cannot download the certificate in that system. Rather, this certificate is automatically sent to your a-kassa, you go to a-kassa's My Pages and check the information shown on the certificate. If everything is correct, click submit.

In the a-kassa system, apart from updating your profile and confirming your employer certificate, you need to submit a weekly report during your unemployment period. Meanwhile, I was told by the operator to upload my PhD diploma in the system.

I was told it would take **2-3** weeks to evaluate the case and give the decision. 

The compensation from A-kassa works like below:![A-kassa](Fig/A-kassa.png)

Thus, you only get 80% of 33 000 SEK of your salary for the first 100 days, and 80% of 27 500 SEK of your salary for the next 100 days. If you want the compensation to top-up to your original salary, you would need another insurance, which is usually from your union.



## Union side

There are many benefits when you are a member of a union, and income insurance is one among them. The income insurance is not provided directly by the union, it is a benefit bound with a commercial insurance company, [Folksam](https://www.folksam.se/) in my case. If you are a member of the union, you will be offered free income insurance for a period of time, which helps you top up the base 33 000 SEK to your original salary. This compensation is paid for a maximum of 150 days.

[The information for the steps to apply for compensation on SULF webpage](https://sulf.se/en/work-salary-and-benefits/unemployment/4-steps-if-you-become-unemployed/)

To apply for this supplemental compensation, you need to first have the decision from A-kassa and enclose that file with your application for compensation from the income insurance company.

Note this can be applied after the 44 days from [Trygghetsstiftelsen](https://www.tsn.se/) have ended. You cannot get two supplementary income insurance at a time. After 44 days,  you can get a certificate from Trygghetsstiftelsen. You need that to apply for insurance from your insurance company.



## Insurance company side

Combining the A-kassa and the union, you are entitled to get the 80% of your original salary, for a maximum of 150 days.

Then if you buy *Income insurance Voluntary supplement* in your insurance company, the benefits of compensation of 80% of your original salary can be extended to 300 days. Note that for some cases you need to choose different levels of the *income insurance supplement* based on your current salary. Make sure your current salary sits in that range.

## Time line for my case

**Aug 29**: get the employer certificate.

**Sep 3**: submit the employer certificate in the A-kassa system.

**Sep 4**: upload my PhD diploma in the A-kassa system.

**Sep 8**: had a call with an arbetsförmedlingen staff who gave me some suggestions about the processes in job-seeking status. I also told them my case about the time for my registration in a-kassa system (I was a bit late due to that I was waiting for my salary update). You need to:

* Submit [activity report](https://arbetsformedlingen.se/for-arbetssokande/arbetslos---vad-hander-nu/aktivitetsrapportera) each month (6 each month).
* If I want to take Swedish courses, I need to first get the approval from my a-kassa.
* Some useful links regarding training and job ads publishing.

**Sep 13**: get the update from a-kassa, asking about my time-report and an extended employer certificate Aug 1 - Aug14 (my previous employer certificate only states from 2024-Aug to 2025-Jul).

**Sep 15**: I called the Arbetsförmedlingen in the morning and in the afternoon they issued an extended employer certificate to me in [Arbetsgivaringtyg](https://www.arbetsgivarintyg.nu/#/). So I went to A-kassa system and confirmed and submitted. Also, I downloaded my salary specification in [Kivra](https://kivra.se/sv/privat) and submitted in the A-kassa system.

In parallel, I had an almost 1.5h meeting with my advisor from [Trygghetsstiftelsen](https://www.tsn.se/). I personally feel he gave me many useful tips:

* [Taking courses while you are unemployed](https://www.akademikernasakassa.se/en/benefits/rules-and-terms/part-time-studies). Maybe the most important is the Swedish course, SFI. Apart from this, [Trygghetsstiftelsen](https://www.tsn.se/) also has their own course platform where you can take them for free for 12 months. I was suggested to take the course about " <span style="color:brown">Karriärresan</span>".
* Rules and benefits that apply while you are unemployed. Pls check the [website](https://www.akademikernasakassa.se/en/benefits/rules-and-terms). I was informed that I can try to apply for compensation about the course fee and some travel fee regarding the interview. But always first check with your advisor.
* There are some useful seminars on their platform, i.e., spontaneous application, and interview training. He suggests me to keep an eye for that. 
* There is a job-application helper platform where a third party, goMonday, has a contract with the system to help job seekers improve their CVs and cover letters.
* I will be assigned a job coach who will give me more guidance about my CV, cover letter, application, interviews, and so on. I am entitled to 5 hrs in total.
* Case of internship while you are unemployed.
* 44 days of supplementary unemployment insurance that you can apply to before you apply for the supplementary unemployment insurance from your insurance company.

**Sep 16**: I received the decision from A-kassa. They replied very quickly. However, from the A-kassa system I was only registered from **Sep 8th** (when I had my first appointment with <span style="color:brown">Arbetsförmedlingen</span>). Thus, the decision letter only approved me to get my compensation from Sep 8th. I called both <span style="color:brown">Arbetsförmedlingen</span> and A-kassa. Then I found a certificate in the  <span style="color:brown">Arbetsförmedlingen</span> system stating that I registered in <span style="color:brown">Arbetsförmedlingen</span> from Aug 15th. I uploaded that certificate in the A-kassa system and messaged them about my situation.

**Sep 17**: I received the new decision from A-kassa stating that I am eligible to get my compensation from Aug 15th. I applied for the A-kassa supplement in the [Trygghetsstiftelsen](https://www.tsn.se/) system (You go to *main page* $\rightarrow$ *Menu*$\rightarrow$*My economy*$\rightarrow$*A-kassa supplement*).

**Sep 18**: Received the decision from [Trygghetsstiftelsen](https://www.tsn.se/) and they asked me to give consent for them to approach my data in A-kassa system. So I did that in A-kassa system.  Then I contacted folksam for the supplementary compensation. Had a meeting with my job coach.

**Oct 29:** I get the certificate from Trygghetsstiftelsen and reported my unemployment at [Folksam](https://folksam.sweetsystems.se/web/Survey/AnswerSurvey/5bcf3848-8bc5-40c1-9fe8-a0149565060e?close=1).

**Jan 7:** I accept an offer from a company😃:.



## If you find a job...

Congratulations! :confetti_ball:

Then you can just de-register yourself at Arbetsförmedlingen. The a-kassa and Folksam income insurance is automatically connected with Arbetsförmedlingen, so you normally do not need to do anything. (I have checked with both a-kassa and Folksam).
